        <h3>Blog 1 - The Bunt BBQ at Bishop DIY</h3>
        <p>Posted on 8/19/2025, Written by Zachary Baur</p>
        <p>On August 17, 2025 in Detroit, Michigan, world famous skatebaording podcast "The Bunt" took over Bishop DIY Skatepark to host a bbq, skate contest, and some basketball goodness. Backed by some of the best in the biz like Pluskateboarding, Satans Drano, and monster, The Bunt supplied the ctiy of detroit with good food, good vibes, and goood skating. It wasn't only the Bunt crew though, they brought along some friends of the show and well-known rippers in the skate community, JP Souza, Sean Malto, Jesse Alba, and Jake Anderson to come and shred up the park with the locals. The event started out chill with the pros and locals warming up and skating the park, preparing for the up-coming contest they would be participating in later that day. Once the contest got under way, the first obstacle that was skated was the bank to ledge, then it was the pyramid to curb in the middle of the park, finally it ended off with everyone skating the bump-to-can. After the contest was over and the hot dogs were flowing, it was on to the basketball court for a quick game of lightning. All the skaters who participated in the contest were able to play against the Bunt boys and the pros, which ended with Cephas from The Bunt securing the victory. Overall a great way to spend a Saturday with the boys, chilling, skating, and eating some good hotdogs.</p>

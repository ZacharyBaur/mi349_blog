        <h3>Story:</h3>
        <p>My day normally starts off with me waking up an hour or two before my first class. I usually lay in bed for a little bit, then get up and brush my teeth, get dressed, and get my school bag ready. In my school bag is:
    <ul>
        <li>Laptop</li>
        <li>Planner</li>
        <li>Textbooks</li>
        <li>Pencils</li>
        <li>Folder</li>
    </ul>
    Once im in my apartment living room, I make myself some breakfast. I usually have either waffles or cereal, <em>my favorite is honey nut Cheerios</em>! After breakfast I try to get some homework done before my class, either reading or watching lecture videos and taking notes. When it gets close to class time I get in my car and drive to campus, ready for learning! After class I head back to my apartment, and my roomates are normally back from class when I get home. I make some lunch and then start working on homework in the living room with my roomates. After we get all of our homework done for the day, we will have some fun <strong>watching TV or playing some video games together</strong>. When it gets later in the evening we might run errands such as grocery shopping or going to an <a href="https://msu.campuslabs.com/engage/organization/reach">MSU club meeting</a>, but if not, then we are cooking dinner. Some of our favorite meals to cook are:
    <ol>
        <li>Burgers</li>
        <li>Chicken Alfredo</li>
        <li>Orange Chicken w/ Rice</li>
    </ol>
    After eating we all start to retire to our rooms, where I brush my teeth and get ready for bed. When I am in bed, I might watch some TV or play on my Xbox before setting my alarms and heading to bed, ready for another day!</p>
